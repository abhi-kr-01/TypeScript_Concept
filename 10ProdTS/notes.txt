It will make tsconfig.json -> for typescript

2. initialise the npm "npm init -y"
it will show some package.json for your project 

3. make dir src,dist in root of project folder
-> we will write code in index.ts in src but after compilation it's js file will make in dist 
-> to do this we have to go "tsconfig.json" in that file -> outdir -> uncomment this
-> // or we can write command to do continuos watching "tsc -w"
"tsc -w"
